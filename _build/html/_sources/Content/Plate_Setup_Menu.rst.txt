Plate Setup Menu
================

The **Plate Setup** menu contains settings for all of your plate types.
Upon installation, the FORMULATRIX support team will configure the
properties for optimal image quality and performance. If you need a new
plate type added to your imager, then please contact
support@formulatrix.com for help. We only recommend advanced users
modify these settings. The information in this menu is for lab managers
so that they may adjust settings as they see fit.

The **Plate Setup** menu comprises three sub-menus:

-  `Plate Type Calibration <About_Plate_Type_Calibration.html>`__
-  `Default Imaging Settings <Defining_Default_Imaging_Settings.html>`__
-  `Image Mask <Applying_Image_Masks.html>`__

In all of these sub-menus, the `manual imaging
controls <Optics_and_Camera_Control_Panel.html>`__ are
available in the **Control Panel** area to help you navigate between the
wells and manipulate the optics and camera settings without having to go
to the **Imager** menu.
