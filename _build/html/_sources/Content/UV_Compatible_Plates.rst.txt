UV Compatible Plates
====================

Not all crystallography consumables are compatible with ultraviolet
light. Cover media can either block the excitation light (absorb UV
radiation in the 250-320 nm band) or it can fluoresce in the same band
that tryptophan does, creating a high level of background noise (this is
a process commonly called autofluorescence). Crystallization plates can
also autofluoresceThe term 'autofluorescence' is a bit of a misnomer.
Typically, you've done something to make your target fluoresce, and this
noise-contributing fluorescence happens automatically, hence
autofluorescence. Here, we're using the intrinsic fluorescence of
tryptophan, which is the exception rather than the rule in fluorescence
microscopy. Our desired sigal is, in a sense, already autofluorescence.
In this document though, we use the term autofluorescence to refer to
undesired noise from the cover media or plate., increasing unwanted
noise. The challenge of absorption is not a problem in crystallization
plates for we have positioned the UV light source and camera of our
imagers above the plates.

To recap, there are three consumable-related problems that could reduce
the signal-to-noise ratio while imaging using UV light (listed in the
order of what seems most common and serious):

-  Crystallization plate could autofluoresce, increasing noise (common
   in polystyrene plates).

-  Cover media could absorb some/all of the UV excitation light,
   reducing the signal strength (This can be partially recovered with
   longer exposure times).

-  Cover media could autofluoresce, increasing noise (common in glass
   cover slides).

.. tip:: Plates and cover media that offer "low birefringence" seem to also have low autofluorescence. Because of this, these plates are recommended for use in UV imaging.

FORMULATRIX has tested several cover medias and plates. For the most up
to date information, please see the `online FORMULATRIX Plate
Guide <http://formulatrix.com/protein-crystallization/plateguide.html>`__.
