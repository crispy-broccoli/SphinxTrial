UV light Path
=============

The UV light path is best explained with a diagram.

-  The excitation light is projected onto the protein crystal via the
   condenser lens - dichroic - UV objective optical chain. (Blue arrow)

-  The tryptophan amino acid flouresces under the UV illumination. (Red
   arrow)

-  The emission light passes through the UV objective, dichroic,
   emission filter, and is focused on the CCD sensor by a UV relay lens.

**Key**: Blue lines indicate excitation light, red lines indicate
emission light.
