Licensing
=========

ROCK IMAGER FT needs an active license to run. 
Every ROCK IMAGER FT purchase comes with an *Instrument* license that encompasses all features and allows you to use the software indefinitely.

FORMULATRIX offers annual maintenance which provides you 
with all the latest updates to the ROCK IMAGER FT and access to FORMULATRIX’s world-class support. 
The first year of maintenance is included with the purchase of ROCK IMAGER FT, no additional fees required. You can choose to renew afterwards.

About Maintenance
-----------------

* You can continue to use ROCK IMAGER FT even after your maintenance coverage expires, 
  but you won’t have access to new software updates. If you wish to have access to future upgrades and support, 
  you can opt to pay annual maintenance by contacting sales@formulatrix.com.

* If you are out of maintenance and wish to get back on it, then you must pay back maintenance to renew. 
  For example, if your maintenance expired in June '10 and you want to renew maintenance in December '10, 
  then you must pay back maintenance to cover the time period of June to December. 
  In this scenario, purchasing 1 year of maintenance will cover you from June '10 to June '11.
  Any support call purchased during a repayment period will be credited towards your next maintenance payment.

* If you are out of maintenance you can choose to purchase support time at an hourly rate and pay for time and materials for hardware related issues separately.

* Software maintenance includes:
    - all product upgrades (excluding installation), 
    - on-site support to fix problems, phone support, and
    - remote support (via remote connectivity tools like VPN access, WebEx, GoToMyPC.com, etc).

* Hardware maintenance includes:
    - all parts, 
    - labor, 
    - on-site support, 
    - phone support, and 
    - remote support (via remote connectivity tools like VPN access, WebEx, GoToMyPC.com, etc) that are required to keep the hardware operational (including monitoring and responding to regular diagnostics).

* Hardware maintenance does not cover any damage to the system due to abuse of the system, system modifications, or misuse of the system by the customer. 
  Travel and shipping expenses including shipping of defective parts during the maintenance (warranty) period will be billed separately at actual cost. 
  A fixed cost option is available (if desired). Software and hardware maintenance do not include extended user training, they only cover training at the time of hardware installation.
