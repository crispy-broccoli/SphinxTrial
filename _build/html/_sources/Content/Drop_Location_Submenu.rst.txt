Drop Location Overview
----------------------

.. index:: Drop Location
   
The **Drop Location** algorithm in ROCK IMAGER FT is useful for hanging
drop experiments, as the location of the drop varies in this type of
experiment. ROCK IMAGER FT is very accurate when detecting drop
locations, so it can differentiate droplet condensation, semi-circular
objects, and LCP plate tape from sample drops.

The **Drop Location** algorithm can be initiated manually from the
`Optics and Camera Control panel <Optics_and_Camera_Control_Panel.html>`__ and is sometimes
executed as part of the automatic imaging of a plate. Whether or not
itâ€™s executed every time a plate is imaged or only during the first
imaging session is determined in the `Plate Setup menu <../Plate_Setup_Menu/Plate_Setup_Menu.html>`__. 
Executing the **Drop Location** algorithm only in the first imaging session is advantageous for quicker future imaging sessions.

However, if you want to see how the drop location algorithm works, you
can do it in **Manual Mode** by clicking the **Drop Location** button in
the **Live Image** sub-menu. This action will only execute the drop
location algorithm on the drop currently in view.

.. _Manually:

Manually Executing Drop Location
--------------------------------

**Prerequisites**:

-  ROCK IMAGER FT is in **Manual Mode**.

-  You have placed the plate under the Visible imager.

**To manually execute drop location**:

#. In the **Live Image** sub-menu of the **Imager** menu, turn the
   **Live Stream** ON.

#. Select **Locate Drop** from the **Optics and Camera Control** panel.

#. Go to the **Drop Location** sub-menu to see the algorithm results.

As shown in the image above, once ROCK IMAGER FT has located a drop, a
red box will appear around the drop. The right side shows how the
algorithm works to locate a drop.

When ROCK IMAGER executes the drop location algorithm, the drop area is
imaged with a large field of view, and the lighting is set in order to
create shadowing within the drop. ROCK IMAGER FT then analyzes the image
to locate the contrast between the shadow in the drop and the rest of
the image, and zooms in on the shadowed area. The imager then uses
normal imaging settings to photograph the drop.

.. note:: The red plus symbol indicates the center of the drop, while the green plus indicates the center of the image.

.. _Clearing_Drop:

Clearing Drop Locations
-----------------------

Occasionally you may need to clear a drop location on a per-drop or
per-plate basis. For example, if your drop grows beyond the original
drop size, you may need to clear the drop location and run the drop
location algorithm again in order to get the best images of your drops.

**Prerequisites**:

-  ROCK IMAGER FT has already identified drop locations on your plate.

-  You want to remove one or all of the drop locations.


**To clear drop locations on a per-plate basis**:

#. In the **Plate** menu, go to the **Search** or **Load Port** tab and
   locate the desired plate.

   **OR**

   If the plate is currently under the imager, go to the **Live Image** sub-menu.

#. If the plate is inside the imager, click **Clear Drop** and select **Clear All Drop Locations**.

   **OR**

   If the plate is in the Storage or Load Port, select the desired plate
   and click **Clear All Drop Locations** on the command panel that appears.

#. When the confirmation message below appears, select **Yes** if you
   want to clear drop locations in ROCK MAKER (or another LIMS) too.

   cleared.

**To clear drop locations on a per-drop basis**:

.. note:: This option can only be done if the plate is under an imager. If it's not already, locate the plate in the **Search** tab and move it to the imager.

#. Go to the **Live Image** sub-menu and turn the **Live Stream** ON.

#. Using the well graphic in the **Well Control** panel, select the drop
   of interest. Click **Clear Drop** in the toolbar area and select
   **Clear Current Drop Location**.

#. When the confirmation message below appears, select **Yes** if you
   want to clear drop locations in ROCK MAKER (or another LIMS) too.
