.. Warning:: Do NOT open the main door and leave the internal components out in the open unless special instruction is given from FORMULATRIX support. Doing so could potentially void the warranty.

.. rubric:: Power Switch

The Power Switch turns ROCK IMAGER FT ON and OFF. You should leave the
imager powered ON during idle times to allow for automatic scheduled
imaging and to maintain a constant temperature for any plates stored in
the system’s hotels.

.. index:: Hotels

.. rubric:: Front and Back Hotels

A hotel is composed of slots where each microplate is stored. The system
is ergonomically designed to accommodate up to 260 SBS plate types,
which are interchangeable with LCP plates. The front hotel, visible from
the front part of the system, can accommodate up to 60 SBS-footprint
plates. The back hotels can house up to 189 plates.

An individual stripe is installed on each slot in the back hotels which
increases static friction, thus preventing the plates from shifting due
to vibrations. In both the front and Load Port hotels, registers are
present on every slot that serve a similar purpose.

.. warning:: Do NOT attempt to physically reach inside the ROCK IMAGER FT’s hotels except for the ones located in the Load Port.

.. index:: Load Port

.. rubric:: Load Port Door

The clear acrylic door provides you with direct access to the plates
stored in the Load Port hotels. A passive pneumatic hinge feature helps
to keep the door from swinging freely when it’s opened. A gentle nudge
will have the door closing itself slowly, thus preventing the door from
slamming.

.. rubric:: SBS and Linbro Hotels in Load Port

ROCK IMAGER FT provides you with one dedicated Linbro hotel in the Load
Port and up to 10 slots for SBS-footprint plates. The Load Port is the
only area in the ROCK IMAGER FT that you have direct access to.

.. rubric:: Imager

ROCK IMAGER FT includes Visible lightpath as the default imaging mode,
and comes with optional Ultraviolet (UV) and Single Light Path (SLP)
imaging modes.

.. index:: Imager

.. rubric:: Temperature Control

ROCK IMAGER FT can monitor and regulate temperatures to within 1° C with
the assistance of its air circulation system. The system’s temperature
can be controlled from 4° C up to 30° C. An external industrial water
chiller is used to cool the interior down to 4° C. Additionally, two
heaters are utilized to regulate temperature up to 30° C.
