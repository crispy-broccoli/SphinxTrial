Schedule Menu
=============

The **Schedule** menu displays a list of all automated imaging tasks in
chronological order as defined in ROCK MAKER. This menu consists of two
tabs: **Queued Schedule** and **Future Schedule**.

Queued Schedule Tab
-------------------

This tab lists all plates that are currently waiting to be imaged. Each
imaging schedule is moved from the **Future Schedule** tab to this queue
on the day of its scheduled time.

Future Schedule Tab
-------------------

The **Future Schedule** tab displays future imaging tasks for all plates
in the system. Once you add a plate to ROCK IMAGER FT, its imaging
schedules automatically populate on this tab.

You can look at the **Priority** column to see which plates will be
imaged first. Plates with a higher priority are imaged first. For
example, a plate with priority 1 will be imaged before a plate with
priority 4. The number of priorities are auto-generated by the system.

The highest priority is 0. Plates with this priority will be imaged as
soon as the imager is available.

Once you select one of the schedules on either the **Queued Schedule**
or **Future Schedule** tab, you will be provided with a command panel
that has the following options:
