.. _Last_Captured_Submenu:

Last Captured Sub-menu
======================

Think of this sub-menu as a view of your last captured drop images. The
last image displayed under the **Live Stream** (accessible from the Live
Image sub-menu) will be shown here. If you turn the Live Stream OFF and
then turn it back ON, the Last Captured sub-menu will update the drop
image as well.

In the image below, the right panel shows the same drop image taken by
different lightpaths. If the plate is not imaged by a specific
lightpath, the display for that lightpath will be blank in the Last
Captured sub-menu.

.. note:: To access this feature, go to the **Imager** menu and click the **Last Captured** sub-menu.
