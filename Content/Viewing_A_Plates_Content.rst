Viewing A Plate's Content
==========================

.. index:: Live Stream, Manual Inspection

ROCK IMAGER FT’s **Live Stream** feature allows you to view and explore
the contents of your plates in real time. You can use the powerful
optics and manual imaging controls to navigate between the wells, zoom
in on the drops, and see how much your crystals have grown.

.. warning:: If you are viewing a plate image, be aware that leaving the **Live Stream** ON for an extended period of time can cause thermal
   decomposition to your samples. Moreover, turning the **Live Stream** OFF
   when not actively inspecting a well’s content increases the longevity of the light source.

**Prerequisites**:

-  You have `added the plate to ROCK IMAGER FT and moved the plate to
   the desired imager <Adding_and_Removing_Plates.html>`__.

-  ROCK IMAGER FT is in **Manual Mode**.

   .. note:: You can still view your plate's content in **Auto Mode**, but the manual imaging controls will not be available.

**To view a plate's content**:

#. On the **Imager** menu, go to the **Live Image** sub-menu.

#. Turn the **Live Stream** ON.

#. Use the `Well Control <Well_Control_Panel.html>`__ to navigate between the wells and explore the contents of your plate.

   .. tip::: To save a picture of a live image, right-click the image and select **Save image as**.

#. **OPTIONAL**: In the **Optics and Camera Control** panel, the **Load
   Settings** option lets you view the live image using its specific
   imaging settings, as defined in ROCK MAKER. This feature allows you
   to easily see how the image changes as you switch between imaging
   settings.
