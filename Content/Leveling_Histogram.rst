Leveling Histogram
==================

The **Leveling Histogram** is useful for adjusting the brightness and contrast settings of a live image. These settings can be changed in
either **Manual Mode** or **Auto Mode**, on the **Live Image** sub-menu.

When you change the **Leveling Histogram**, the display of the live image only changes when you are viewing it under the live stream. The
original image that is displayed in ROCK MAKER is untouched. However, you can `use the image tuning tool in ROCK MAKER <https://help.formulatrix.com/rock-maker/3.17#Viewing_Images/Concepts/Image_Tuning.htm>`__
to adjust the brightness and contrast tones, which can increase the quality of your drop images.

Working with the histogram
--------------------------

The **Histogram** works through two parameters, the Lower Limit and the
Upper Limit, which are indicated by two scrollbar bubbles below the
histogram.

-  The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 255. Drag the
   scrollbar bubbles or type a new value in the input fields until you
   are satisfied with the results. If you move the left bubble further
   to the left, itâ€™ll increase the brightness of the image.

-  Click the **Auto** button to perform auto-leveling. ROCK IMAGER FT
   will process drop images so that the image has optimum amount of
   leveling automatically. If you navigate to another well while
   auto-leveling is still ON, the system will use the same relative
   amount of leveling on the image currently in view.

-  To reset any changes made to the image, click **Reset**.


.. rubric::   *Example*:

The series of images below depicts the same drop image before and after
the brightness and contrast tones were adjusted using the **Leveling
Histogram**. The image on the left has a high percentage of dark tones,
making it difficult to inspect the details. Meanwhile, the image on the
right contains more drop content details, as the brightness and contrast
have been leveled accordingly.
