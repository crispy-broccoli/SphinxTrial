<h1>UV Compatible Plates</h1>
<p>Not all crystallography consumables are compatible with ultraviolet light. Cover media can either block the excitation light (absorb UV radiation in the 250-320 nm band) or it can fluoresce in the same band that tryptophan does, creating a high level of background noise (this is a process commonly called autofluorescence). Crystallization plates can also <madcap:popup><madcap:popuphead>autofluoresce</madcap:popuphead><madcap:popupbody>The term 'autofluorescence' is a bit of a misnomer. Typically, you've done something to make your target fluoresce, and this noise-contributing fluorescence happens automatically, hence autofluorescence. Here, we're using the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan, which is the exception rather than the rule in fluorescence microscopy. Our desired sigal is, in a sense, already autofluorescence. In this document though, we use the term autofluorescence to refer to undesired noise from the cover media or plate.</madcap:popupbody></madcap:popup>, increasing unwanted noise. The challenge of absorption is not a problem in crystallization plates for we have positioned the UV light source and camera of our imagers above the plates.</p>
<p>To recap, there are three consumable-related problems that could reduce the signal-to-noise ratio while imaging using UV light (listed in the order of what seems most common and serious):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Crystallization plate could autofluoresce, increasing noise (common in polystyrene plates).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover media could absorb some/all of the UV excitation light, reducing the signal strength (This can be partially recovered with longer exposure times).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover media could autofluoresce, increasing noise (common in glass cover slides).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Tip"><b>Tip</b>: Plates and cover media that offer "low birefringence" seem to also have low autofluorescence. Because of this, these plates are recommended for use in UV imaging.</p>
<p>FORMULATRIX has tested several cover medias and plates. For the most up to date information, please see the <a href="http://formulatrix.com/protein-crystallization/plateguide.html" target="_blank">online FORMULATRIX Plate Guide</a>.</p>
