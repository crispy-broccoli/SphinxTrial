<h1>Best Practices</h1>
<div> </div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Do</b> take care when affixing barcode labels to your plates, if you are using barcodes.</p>
</li>
<ul madcap:continue="true" style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>
<p>Always put a barcode on your plate. If you attempt to image a plate without a barcode, your imager could crash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barcodes should always be placed on the short side of the plate away from the A1 location. If you affix the barcode to the wrong side of the plate, the images you see for your drops won't map to the contents of the experiment design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you wrap the barcode label around the side or corner of a plate, the barcode scanner will not be able to read the entire barcode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you leave an area of the label sticking off of a plate, your plate could stick to objects inside the imager.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><b>Do NOT</b> leave tape wrapped around the bottom of a plate. This may cause your images to be out of focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Do</b> follow standard drop position conventions when working on a hanging drop experiment. For example, if you are using a two drop hanging drop plate, your drops should be dispensed from top to bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Do</b> contact FORMULATRIX about a month after first using ROCK IMAGER so that we can review some of your images to ensure you are getting the best performance from your imager.</p>
