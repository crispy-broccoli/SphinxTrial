Manual Activation
=====================

Manual license activation should be done when ROCK IMAGER FT software does not have Internet access to the FORMULATRIX server. 
Manual activation requires you to have a license activation file in .xml format, which can be obtained by sending a license request.

How to submit a license request:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have obtained the license activation file, jump to how to manually activate a license.

1) Run ROCK IMAGER FT software.
2) If your ROCK IMAGER FT is brand new, a **License Violation** dialog box will appear. Click the **Request License** button.

   **OR**

   If you already had a license and wish to renew it, in the **Report and Support** menu, click **Licensing**. 
3) Select **Manual Activation** in the **Request License** dialog box.

        :title: Downloading a License Request File for Manual Activation

    .. centered:: *Downloading a License Request File for Manual Activation*

4) A license request file has been downloaded to your computer that specifies your computerâ€™s name, product type and a license key. Send this file to licensing@formulatrix.com.
   
   .. Note:: You can send the email using a different computer that has active Internet access. 

5) You will shortly receive a license activation file from FORMULATRIX support. Place it somewhere on the computer where your ROCK IMAGER FT software runs, e.g., the Desktop.

   .. Note:: If the license activation file is in a .ZIP format, you need to unpack it first in order to access the .xml file.

6) Then, continue to activate a license manually.
