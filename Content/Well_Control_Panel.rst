Well Control Panel
==================

The **Well Control** panel is found on the **Live Image** sub-menu of
the **Imager** menu. This panel is enabled when RIFT is in **Manual
Mode** to help you explore the content of your plate and inspect the
drop of interest during manual inspection.

-  The **Well-based Movement** graph represents the plate currently
   under the imager. To view a drop of interest, simply click the
   corresponding well and select the correct drop from the **Drop** list
   at the top of the panel.

-  The **Fine Tuning Movement** controls contain control pads that let
   you navigate within the drop. You can also adjust the speed of the
   robot arm’s movement using the **Slow** and **Fast** scrollbar.

   ► Left and right arrows control the plate movement along the X axis.

   ► Up and down arrows control the plate movement along the Y axis.

   ► Up and down arros (located to the right) control the plate movement
   along the Z axis.

   ► The **C** button in the middle moves the X, Y, and Z coordinates
   back to the zero (0) position, which centers the current drop
   position under the microscope.

-  You can also navigate around the well using the number pad on your
   keyboard. The following number-pad keys will move the plate along the
   three axes of the robot arm.

   .. note:: Number Lock on your keyboard must be enabled.

   ► Use 4 and 6 to move along the X axis.

   ► Use 8 and 2 to move along the Y axis.

   ► Use 9 and 3 to move along the Z axis.
