UV Absorption Imaging
=====================

Many samples, including RNA, DNA, and protein absorb UV which can be
used to create contrasting images. The UV absorption imager transmits UV
light through the sample and then detects the same wavelength UV light
on the camera. Areas that absorb the UV light create contrast, enabling
you to see differentiating features in your crystallization drops. UV
absorption can be helpful for imaging drops that are not UV fluorescent,
for example, DNA, RNA, and proteins without tryptophan.
