Although most imaging sessions are executed in **Auto Mode** according
to the imaging schedule set in ROCK MAKER, itâ€™s possible to override the
**Auto Mode** and create an on-demand imaging session from ROCK IMAGER
FT. Follow the tutorial below to initiate an imaging session.

**Prerequisite**:

-  You have `added a plate to ROCK IMAGER FT <Adding_and_Removing_Plates.html>`__.

**To image a plate**:

#. On the **Search** tab of the **Plate** menu, locate the plate of
   interest and select it by checking the checkbox next to it. If you
   want to image more than one plate, check the checkboxes next to any
   other desired plate rows.

#. Once you select the plate(s), click **Image Now** in the command
   panel that appears.

   **Note**: **Image Now** feature can also be found on the **Schedule**
   menu and **Live Image** sub-menu of the **Imager** menu.

#. Then, select level and imaging settings when prompted. Click **OK**
   when done.

   -  **Level**: Select **Interesting Drop(s)** to image only `drops
      marked as Interesting <https://help.formulatrix.com/rock-maker/3.17#Viewing_Images/Tutorials/Tagging_Interesting_Drops.htm>`__
      or **Plate(s)** to image the entire plate.

   -  **Imaging Settings**: Choosing **Default Settings** will tell ROCK
      IMAGER FT to use the default settings defined in ROCK MAKER.
      Select **Custom Settings** to define new imaging settings for this
      particular imaging session.

#. Once your plate has been imaged at least once, you can `view and
   score images with ROCK MAKER <https://help.formulatrix.com/rock-maker/3.17#Viewing_Images/Viewing_Images.htm>`__.
