Searching for Plate
===================

Once a plate is inside ROCK IMAGER FT, it could be placed in the
Storage, under the imager, or in the Load Port. If you are not sure
where a plate is, but you know it’s inside the system, you can use the
**Search** sub-tab of the **Plates** menu to find it.


**Prerequisites**:

To find a plate, you will need to know at least one of the following:

-  Project Name

-  Experiment Name

-  Plate Number

-  Date Dispensed

-  User Name (Owner)

-  Plate Type

-  Plate ID

-  Barcode

-  Location

-  Status

**To search a plate**:

#. Go to the **Plates** menu and click the **Search** tab.

#. Enter any information about the plate into the appropriate field
   under the correct column. For example, if you know the plate’s
   barcode number, type it under the barcode column (See the image
   below; marked in an orange square).

   A command panel will appear and provide you with the following
   options:

   .. centered::   *Plate-related Command Panel*

   -  Create an on-demand imaging session by selecting the **Image Now**
      option. ROCK IMAGER FT will create a schedule for this plate,
      which you can see on the **Queued Schedule** tab of the
      **Schedule** menu. Its priority is 0, which means it will be
      imaged immediately or as soon as the imager isn’t busy. Read
      Initiating an On-Demand Imaging Session for more details.

   -  Move the plate to either Storage, the Load Port, or the Imager by
      selecting **Move Plate To**.

   -  See the plate’s automatic imaging schedules and other information
      by selecting **Plate Information**.

   -  Remove drop location positions on the entire plate by selecting
      **Clear All Drop Locations**.
